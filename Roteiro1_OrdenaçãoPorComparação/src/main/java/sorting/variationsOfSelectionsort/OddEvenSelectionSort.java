 * This algorithm simulates a logical partitioning of the input array by considering

 * the second sub-array is indexed by odd elements. Then, it applies a complete selectionsort
 * in the first sub-array considering neighbours (even). After that, 
 * it applies a complete selectionsort in the second sub-array considering
 * neighbours (odd).  After that, the algorithm performs a merge between elements indexed
 * by even and odd numbers.
